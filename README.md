# Image-Classification-through-ML

This project focuses on the concept of how neural networks can be trained to identify the micro category of a product using its images.

The step-by-step detailed explanation for the procedure is given in my [medium article.](https://towardsdatascience.com/product-image-classification-with-deep-learning-part-i-5bc4e8dccf41)

## Dependencies

- Download or clone the ResNet model from Facebookâ€™s [Github](https://github.com/facebookarchive/fb.resnet.torch) link.
- Install the Torch ResNet dependencies on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) 14.04+:
- Install [Torch](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html) on a machine with CUDA GPU (NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 3.5 or above)
- Install [cuDNN v4 or v5](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) and the Torch [cuDNN bindings](https://github.com/soumith/cudnn.torch/tree/R4)

  See the installation instructions for a [step-by-step guide](https://github.com/facebookarchive/fb.resnet.torch/blob/master/INSTALL.md).
  
  All the python scripts, sql queries, bash scripts,etc required to extract and process the dataset have been included in this repository.
